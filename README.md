# Advent of Code 2016 Solutions

Just to be clear - don't use any of this code for anything important.

I use Ruby daily, so I'm using the Ruby solutions to these exercises to explore different approaches to the problems than I might normally take.  This will probably result in some wierd and non-optimal solutions.

The Elixir and Rust solutions are being used to explore the languages from a beginner viewpoint.  They will most likely not be to standards to start with.  Nor will each exercise be completed in each language.

Not all solutions will have testing defined - it depends on the time that I have available to myself and what I'm trying to explore with the exercise.
